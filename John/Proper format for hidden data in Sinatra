If you run new favorite numbers and don't put anything into the fields, it prints "hidden" in a text box on the screen. You've got
    <input type ="text" name="user_name" value = <%= name%> hidden>
so if name is empty, it sends 
    <input type ="text" name="user_name" value = hidden> 
to the browser. 
Remember, the correct format of an html tag is one element_name followed by attribute_name=attribute_value pairs.
Also hidden is a valid type for input, so I'd write:
    <input type ="hidden" name="user_name" value ="<%= name%>" >
